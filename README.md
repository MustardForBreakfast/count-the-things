# Count The Things.

A really, really simple browser app to count things... because sometimes, thats all you need to do.

Try it [here](https://mustardforbreakfast.github.io/count-the-things).

For a slightly-more useful "multiplayer" variant of this project that uses Websockets, go [here](https://github.com/MustardForBreakfast/count-the-things-multiplayer).
